# cin, cout for Arduino
A lightweight, modular implementation of cin/cout-style streaming for Arduino, with UTF-8 support and customizable formatting.

The library provides standard C++ access to the serial console by implementing ostream and istream instances (cout and cin), along with convenient construction of a custom UTF-8 locale.
